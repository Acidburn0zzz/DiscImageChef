How to test and bug report
==========================

First of all take in account that DiscImageChef master from git is unstable, prone to crashing and not working as expected, so don't suppose anything will work at all.
Specially compiling.

Once you've taken that in account normal testing procedures apply.

You must report bugs using GitHub issues facilities.

Sending an email telling the bug is the perfect way to get it forgotten in oblivion.

In the bug report you must indicate the following:
- Your operating system exact version, release and distribution
- The .NET Framework or Mono version you used to run DiscImageChef
- The exact command line used
- Expected results
- If DiscImageChef was used against a disk image you may need to provide us a copy
- If DiscImageChef was used against a device or physical media you may need to retest it several times

When you create the issue I'll check it as soon as I can and provide feedback.
However, solving it, will enter in the current queue of things to do.
