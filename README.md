Works under any operating system where there is Mono or .NET Framework. Tested with Mono 3.0.

Features
========
* Analyzes a disk image getting information about the disk itself and analyzes partitions and filesystems inside them
* Can checksum the disks (and if optical disc, separate tracks) user-data (tags and metadata coming soon)
* Can compare two disk images, even different formats, for different sectors and/or metadata
* Can list and extract contents from filesystems that support that
* Can read several disk image formats.
* Can read several known sector by sector formats with variable bytes per sector.
* Can read standard sector by sector copies for optical and magnetic discs with constant bytes per sector.
* Can verify sectors or disk images if supported by the underlying format
