Hardware donations
==================

This is a list of hardware that I'm searching but is too rare or too expensive for me to get them.
The reason I want this hardware is because having it is the only way to add enhanced support for them (e.g. media detection, ECC support, raw dumping, etc.).
After adding enhanced support all drives will be given to the Canary Islands Computer Museum.
